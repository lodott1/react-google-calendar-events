# react-google-calendar-events #

## Two components: ##
### Calendar which runs the Ajax call ###
### Events which processes the returned Ajax call and renders the data ###

Background: Yes, I know, why not just embed the google calendar and be done with it? I figured I wanted to learn working with APIs, and I always preferred to do my own styling. So I decided on Ajax-fetching that data and rendering it out myself. With React, of course.

## What you need ##

1. A google calendarID and an apiKey. Follow this guide to find your google calendarID. For the apiKey, see here: http://docs.simplecalendar.io/google-api-key/

2. A public google calendar.

Thats it! I've added a "calendar.scss" just for fun, with a simple styling for the whole calendar. I have omitted the index.js, as you probably know where you want to store these components.

## Feel free to use this however you want! ##

If you find some other cool uses for this, please let me know! And bugs. Those squashy bugs. If you find them, please fix and report.
This is my first component that I'm publishing, so please be gentle! I know my code sucks for now, but it will improve with time. I hope that you'll take the time to enlighten me if/when you see some horrendous mistakes. That is much appreciated!
